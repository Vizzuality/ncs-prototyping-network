      'Peatland ecosystem has been disturbed by anthropogenic activities that causes peat degradation. In the past 7 years, the Government of Indonesia has been implementing peatland restoration in several priority provinces, including West Kalimantan. The government and partners built canal blockings to rewet the peatlands, but there is almost no information quantifying their impacts. We want to quantify the impact of peatland rewetting on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions – CO2 and CH4 – in relation with environmental paramaters. We measured CO2 and CH4 fluxes from January-December 2022 using LiCOR LI-7810 trace gas analyzer in several land covers, including smallholder oil palm plantation, secondary forest, shrub, and mixed agriculture in Mempawah and Kubu Raya Regencies in West Kalimantan, Indonesia. We designed our research by making transects in drained and rewetted plots and installing chambers. Our preliminary results show significant CO2 emissions reduction in oil palm plantations.',

      'Peatland ecosystem has been disturbed by anthropogenic activities that causes peat degradation. In the past 7 years, the Government of Indonesia has been implementing peatland restoration in several priority provinces, including West Kalimantan. The government and partners built canal blockings to rewet the peatlands, but there is almost no information quantifying their impacts. We want to quantify the impact of peatland rewetting on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions – CO2 and CH4 – in relation with environmental paramaters. We measured CO2 and CH4 fluxes from January-December 2022 using LiCOR LI-7810 trace gas analyzer in several land covers, including smallholder oil palm plantation, secondary forest, shrub, and mixed agriculture in Mempawah and Kubu Raya Regencies in West Kalimantan, Indonesia. We designed our research by making transects in drained and rewetted plots and installing chambers. Our preliminary results show significant CO2 emissions reduction in oil palm plantations.',
